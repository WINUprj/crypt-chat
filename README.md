Follow [this link](https://cryp-chat.herokuapp.com/) to visit an actual app.  
Please note that this chat app is little different from orgdinary everyday-use chat app since it is for enjoying encryption!

## Quick User Guide 
1. Register to a website by typing in `username` and `password`. 
2. Now you're in a chat room! Let's start chatting with someone in this room. 
3. Your message should follow a strict syntax, which is : `message` #`encryption algorithm`:`encryption key with length of 16`. 
4. For example : `Two One Nine Two #aes:Thats my Kung Fu`
5. In this app, you cannot switch encryption algorithm as long as you are in free plan. You should sign up for monthly subscription plan which costs you around $3 per month... (just kidding). In fact, we didn't implement other algorithms, so you should use aes all the time to properly encrypt your message. 
6. Once you typed in your message correctly by strictly following syntax, then hooray! You made your message into encrypted message. 
7. Enjoy app by typing in other message or see what others typed in and how those are encrypted. It is always fun to watch how encryption behaves.
